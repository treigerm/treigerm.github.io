  I am a PhD student at the University of Oxford lucky to be supervised by 
  <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/luke.ong/personal/">Luke Ong</a> and 
  <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~twgr/">Tom Rainforth</a>
  as part of the <a href="https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/">AIMS Centre for Doctoral Training</a>. 
  I have broad interests in probabilistic machine learning, Bayesian statistics and 
  deep learning. 
  On a high-level, I like to <i>build tools which help people make better data-driven
  decisions</i>.
  More specifically, I do research in the field of probabilistic 
  programming languages (PPLs). The goal of PPLs is to automate inference for 
  any type of probabilistic model that could be expressed in a programming 
  language.
