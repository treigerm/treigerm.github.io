  I am a postdoc in the <a href="https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/group/climate-processes">Climate Processes group</a> at the University of Oxford, developing novel compression algorithms for atmospheric data.
  I have broad interests in probabilistic machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and deep learning. 
  On a high-level, I like to <i>build tools which help people make better data-driven decisions</i>.
  Before my postdoc, I completed my PhD in Oxford supervised by 
  <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/luke.ong/personal/">Luke Ong</a> and 
  <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~twgr/">Tom Rainforth</a>
  as part of the <a href="https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/">AIMS Centre for Doctoral Training</a>.
